    "## Full Factorial Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is this: for each factor that might matter, we should pick initial points that span the widest range. (We can come back later for further optimizations in smaller ranges if needed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to capture nonlinear / quadratic behavior, it's often useful to add a few center points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Figures/factorial.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, this full factorial design is also mentioned as $2^k$ design, because at 2 levels for each factor and $k$ factors... it's an exponential number of experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the *statistical power* of our design.\n",

    "<img src=\"./Figures/power-small.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably not. What if the improvement effect was larger .. maybe a difference of 2.0? (This is similar to our t-test and ANOVA questions.. how much separation do we need to detect a difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Figures/power-large.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./Figures/power-expert.png\" width=\"450\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Or if we don't want to do that, we can repeat the measurements because the signal to noise of an average (i.e., the standard error) goes down as you repeat:\n",
